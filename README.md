# Ansible Role: OSX-CI

![GPL-3.0 licensed][badge-license]
[![Build Status](https://github.com/kenhuang/ansible-role-osx-ci/workflows/Publish%20role/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/kenhuang/ansible-role-osx-ci/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Publish+role%22+branch%3Amaster)

Installs and configures software tools needed for building & deploying OSX/iOS applications.
The configured Mac machine can be used as a Jenkins agent.

The role creates a `ci user` that can be used to run builds on the Mac machine. It configures the user to be able to log remotely via ssh.
It also installs:

* [Homebrew][homebrew]
* [Node.js 10 LTS][node10]
* [Java 8][java8] - Jenkins requirement. By installing Java 8, the OSX machine can be easily become a Jenkins agent.
* [fastlane][fastlane]
* [CocoaPods][cocoapods]

## Requirements

The role expects Xcode Command Line Tools to be installed on the target machine. You can find all available versions in the [Apple Downloads Page][apple-downloads].
You can also install the Xcode Command Line Tools via terminal using:

    xcode-select --install

Note that this command requires user input, so you cannot execute it remotely (via ssh).

Because the role needs to set up an authorized ssh key for the ci user that enables remote login, a public ssh key needs to be pre-generated and provided to the role.
The ssh public key needs to be on the machine that `executes` the role.
